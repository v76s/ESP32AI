# ESP32 Coordinate Dashboard Project

## Purpose
This is a **backend + frontend + MCU (ESP32-WROOM-32U)** project.  

- The ESP sends **x,y coordinates**.  
- The backend **catches** them.  
- The frontend **displays** them.  

The MCU implementation is made for **two IDEs**:  
- **Arduino IDE**  
- **VSCode + ESP-IDF (Extension)**  

The project can be built in **two ways**:  
1. **Separate solution** â€“ backend and frontend are separate.  
2. **Single solution** â€“ everything inside a single **Next.js** app.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Separate Solution

### Backend Setup
```bash
mkdir project
cd project
mkdir backend
cd backend

npm init -y   # Creates package.json with default values
npm install ws   # Installs the ws package used for the WebSocket server

code tcp-server.js   # Opens file in VSCode
# If 'code' is not recognized, open VSCode > Command Palette > 
# "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
```

Write the backend code in `tcp-server.js`, then run:
```bash
node tcp-server.js
```

---

### Frontend Setup
```bash
mkdir frontend
cd frontend
npm init -y
```

*(Continue with your frontend implementation here)*

---

## ðŸ”¹ Single Solution (Next.js)

### Create Next.js App
```bash
mkdir project
cd project
npx create-next-app@latest project
```

Answer the prompts as follows:
```
âˆš Would you like to use TypeScript? ... No
âˆš Would you like to use ESLint? ... No
âˆš Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ... Yes
âˆš Would you like your code inside a `src/` directory? ... No
âˆš Would you like to use App Router? ... No
âˆš Would you like to use Turbopack for `next dev`? ... No
âˆš Would you like to customize the import alias? ... No
```

Then install WebSocket:
```bash
cd project
npm install ws
```

---

### Update `package.json`
Make sure your **package.json** looks like this:
```json
{
  "name": "live-dashboard",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "node server.js",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "NODE_ENV=production node server.js",
    "lint": "next lint"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^19.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.0.0",
    "next": "15.3.5"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": "^4",
    "tailwindcss": "^4"
  }
}
```

Write the client and server-side code in their respective folders, then start the project:
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## ðŸš€ Running the Project

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install ws
node tcp-server.js
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ MCU Code

1. Open this folder in VSCode:
   ```
   D:\Work\ProjectsForYourself\Project1\app4\Mcu\ESP-IDF â€“ Micropython\mcu
   ```
2. In **ESP-IDF Explorer**, **flash the device**.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Simulating MCU Code

You can simulate ESP32 coordinate sending via `ncat`:
```bash
echo 10,20 | ncat localhost 5000
echo 30,50 | ncat localhost 5000
echo 100,200 | ncat localhost 5000
```
---

âœ… Now youâ€™re ready to run both **separate** and **single (Next.js)** solutions!
